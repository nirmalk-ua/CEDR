# About CEDR
CEDR is a Linux-based compilation and runtime framework that provides an ecosystem for hardware-software co-design and evaluation of heteregenous SoCs during the pre-silicon design phase. This framework holistically targets three key challenges of SoC design: accelerator integration, resource management, and application development. CEDR is a flexible and lightweight user-space runtime environment that enables easy integration of new accelerators, scheduling heuristics, and user applications.
